# hello-world

Spoken by Jellyfish2016 robot-to-be.
This is a repository exercise to get all our software builders in-sync on using GitHub to collaborate.
If you maded this far, you are one step closer to setting up your software development environment.
Play with the tool, to get familiar on how to:
 * create a "branch" from the master trunk to make changes, 
 * make a "commit", aka edit, add, or delete, to your branch,
 * open a "pull request" to compare the changes from the master trunk, may have discussions with teammates,
 * "merge" a pull request back into the master trunk.

Detail examples can be found at "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/".
Note not to create a new repository in Step 1 of above example.  
You want to work with the existing repository from this "shsvbjv / hello-world" repository; 
so you can add your name at the end of this file.

There is more info on the concept of GitHub at "https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/".
Don't forget to also get the latest Android Studio (Version 2.2, as of 9/19/2016) for IDE.

Congrats!!
